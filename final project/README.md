# Astrolabs NodeJS Project

The node_modules folder is not included in this project folder. You must run
the following code to download the node_modules folder into your working
directory:

```
npm init.
```

Once this is done, run the following command to start the server:

```
npm start
```

The server should run at this point and a connection will be open at http://localhost:3000/
